# ChatGPT Usage Disclosure

ChatGPT was used during development for:
- Structuring the project architecture
- Generating boilerplate code
- Debugging runtime issues
- Reviewing analytics correctness
- Improving documentation clarity

All core logic, design decisions, and final implementation were reviewed,
understood, and integrated manually.

ChatGPT was used as a productivity and reasoning aid, not as a substitute
for understanding or ownership of the code.
